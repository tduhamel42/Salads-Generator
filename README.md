# Salads-Generator

This is a little program that I wrote during my internship. Please do not take this seriously.

## To run it

To run the server:

```
cd server && npm start
```

To run the client (dev mod):

```
cd app && npm run serve
```

## The database

You may want to restore the database, there is a backup in `server/backup_db`.
